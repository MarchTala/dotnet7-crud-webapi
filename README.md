.NET 7 CRUD WEBAPI
======

I've created three branches for my own reference as I continue to learn about the .NET 7 Web API.

I did this to comprehend the difference between the implementation of an in-memory database, 
the implementation of DbContext, and the implementation of Unit of Work (UoW) and 
the Repository Pattern, as well as how they are implemented within a project.


## **1st Branch:**
  - **Branch Name:** "1-of-3-inmemory-database"
  - Utilize in memory database

## **2nd Branch:**
  - **Branch Name:** "2-of-3-DbContext"
  - Implementation of DbContext
  - Utilize in memory database

## **3rd Branch:**
  - **Branch Name:** "3-of-3-uow-repository-pattern"
  - Implementation of Unit Of Work and Repository Pattern
  - Creating a service base approach (UoW)
